    "Mechtronic sensors are sophisticated systems developed and design to convert physical parameters into indicators capable of being measured and processed, intergrated with fundementals of software, electrical and mechanical engineering. Motion sensors have the capability to identify movement in countless environments while manfuctured in different applications. Motion sensors generally operate through infrared, ultrasonic or microwave technologies. Arduino ultrasonic sensors create pulses of ultrasonic sound waves, at a frequency beyond the human hearing, measure the time the echo took to return, calculating the distance with immense accuracy. The Arduino Ultransonic sensor is productive in obstacle detection, avoidance systems and parking lots."

    "In contrary to Motion sensors, light sensors are pieces of technology that observe and measure the intensity of light in an environment. A photoresistor is a light dependent resistor implemented in arduino as they are simple and easy to read resistance values. When the resistance of the photoresistor decreases the light increase, proving its ability to identify changes in the environment. Photoresistors can be used to create autonomous brightness application or light-sensitive alarms"

Their are many types of end effectors, each influenced by the requirements of the applications and the assigned task. The versatility and adaptability make them highly effective and percise in automation. For example, robot grippers are implemented in assembly lines, vary in design based on their purpose. The end effector with the vaccuum is used for picking up and transfering components while the end effector with the saw is used for cutting items. The end effector in the production industry reduces the demand for manual labour while enable accurate and repetitive operations.\n"
